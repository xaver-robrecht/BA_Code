This repository contains all the programs (C, Maple, and Python) that my Bachelor thesis is based on.
The C code is used to calculate spin wave dispersion relations.
The Jupyter notebook contains the notes that eventually were transformed into the full Bachelor thesis.
I also used Matplotlib to generate the plots, so the Jupyter notebook depends on the C code and the executables created from it.
The Maple notebook contains the calculations necessary for my thesis, which were usually rather complex integrals.
