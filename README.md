This repository contains all the programs (C, Maple, and Python) that my Bachelor thesis is based on.
The C code is used to calculate spin wave dispersion relations. The jupyter notebooks runs the c code accordingy and generates plots.
It might be necessary to change the paths in the jupyter notebook to make it run.
